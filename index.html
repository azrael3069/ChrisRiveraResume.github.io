    <h1><u>My Resume</u></h1>
    <p> My name is Christopher Rivera.  I started my coding journey about a year ago by starting to self teach myself.  I then enrolled into Lambda School
     in order to fully enhance my skills for the work force.  The past few years I have been in the health field as a Recovery Specialist, and a Certified Nursing Assisstant. But I needed a change.
     I needed something more.  I took a credited Java class and fell in love from System.out.println("Hello World!");.  I am excited with all I have learned and am excited to learn as much as possible.
     My career goals are to help people by creating apps or websites to change their lives focusing on the health/fitness area.  I am extremely motivated and a fast learner.  </p>
